            JavaScript is a fun and flexible programming language. Itï¿½s one of
            the core technologies of web development and can be used on both the
            front-end and the back-end. While HTML and CSS are languages that
            give structure and colors to web pages, JavaScript makes them
            interactive and come alive.

            Java is one of the most popular programming languages out there.
            Released in 1995 and still widely used today, Java has many
            applications, including software development, mobile applications,
            and large systems development.The JavaScript language resembles Java

            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
            used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
            clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
            server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you
            to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such
            as realtime collaboration between multiple computers).
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example
          </p>

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the scratchpad and your
          first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code>
            >function greetme (yourName) { alert("Hello + yourName" ) ; } greetme ( "world" ) ;
          </code>

            The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers.

            scripts.The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
            Java's static typing and strong type checking.

            The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that
            are appropriate for a JavaScript programmer. unfamiliar to a
            JavaScript programmer. Although the description of the language may
            differ in ECMAScript,

          <p>
            The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may be
            unfamiliar to a JavaScript programmer. Although the description of
            the language may differ in ECMAScript, the language itself remains
            the same. JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the
            ECMAScript specification.
